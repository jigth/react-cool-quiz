# React Cool Quiz

A quiz application for react made using Vite + TypeScript + React.

It uses two main components (app and quiz) and state management and logic for handling the quiz questions. Uses a simple score system and has four questions.

It is very simple but it has been designed in a good enough way so there should be no evident bugs.

## Dependencies.

* NodeJS (version 18.18.0 or later)
* yarn package manager (or NPM)

## Installing and running the app

I will only show instructions for YARN, if you want to use NPM the process is identical, there's not much else to know.

1. Clone the repo and open its root path from a shell (the terminal application)

2. Install packages using a Node package manager such as YARN or NPM and run it

```bash
yarn # Install packages
yarn dev # Run it in dev mode
```
